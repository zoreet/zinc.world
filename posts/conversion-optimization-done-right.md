## Challenge
Help customers find the right property for their trip from the Search Results page. Small changes shipped through A/B tests are not solving the more significant issues of the page. How can we roll out an extensive redesign and still understand each change's value?

## Context
Back then, Booking.com had a very efficient formula to growing the business: **small step optimizations via A/B tests**. If net conversion went up, the tested feature was deemed valuable. Otherwise, it was dropped. And we were discouraged from embarking on long-term projects. Instead, we should ~~tweak the UI~~ get things done.

During my first months in the Search Result team, I ran A/B tests, interviewed users, read research reports, and exchanged knowledge with other teams. Soon I started to feel the **frustration** of restricting ourselves from thinking big and strategic. I decided to **challenge the status quo**, and this is the process that followed.


## Deliverables
- 3 key user goals for the Search Results Page
- Property card and page-level audits
- <span class="redacted"></span> A/B tests out of which <span class="redacted"></span> were successful
- Removed 4 products and features from the page

## Outcome
- <span class="redacted"></span> increase in net conversion, the most successful changes to the Search Results page.
- Proof that a strategic approach to conversion optimization is the most profitable thing to do, even though it's initially slow.
